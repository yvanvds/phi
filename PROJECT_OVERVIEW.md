# Phi — Project Overview

## What this is

Phi is a flexible workstation for live electronic music performance — see
[phi-vision.md](phi-vision.md) for the full vision. Personal years-long
project, Windows desktop only.

## Stack at a glance

| Layer        | Tech                                                  |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Audio engine | C++ (`yse-soundengine`)                               |
| FFI bridge   | `dart-yse` — Dart wrapper, package name `yse`         |
| UI shell     | Flutter ≥ 3.38, Windows desktop                       |
| Design       | Dart tokens derived from `design system/colors_and_type.css` |
| 3D viewport  | bgfx (Phase ≥ 2 — not yet)                            |
| Scripting    | Python with DSL (Phase ≥ 2 — not yet)                 |

`dart-yse` lives at `d:\dart-yse` as a sibling on disk and is consumed via
a path dependency. CI clones both repos as siblings.

## Layered folder structure under `lib/`

One-way dependency flow — top depends on bottom, never the reverse.

```
main + app          (orchestration)
├── shell           (workstation chrome)
├── surfaces        (Scene · Patcher · Code · State · MIDI · Mix)
├── engine          (PhiEngine façade + bridge over package:yse)
├── design          (tokens + reusable widgets — no domain knowledge)
├── domain          (pure-Dart models — session/ wired; more arrives later)
├── platform        (windows-specific bits — empty for now)
└── core            (cross-cutting helpers — empty for now)
```

## Current phase

**Phase 1 — Audio hello-world + workstation chrome.** Implemented:
- Design tokens (colors, type, spacing, motion, radii) in `lib/design/tokens/`
- Theme in `lib/design/theme.dart`
- Widget library: `PrimaryButton`, `PeakMeter`, `Capsule`, `PhiToggle`,
  `InlineEditableText`, `TransportButton`, `RailButton`, `StatusChip`,
  `PhiFader`
- `PhiEngine` façade over a `YseGateway` interface (`RealYseGateway` for
  production, `FakeYseGateway` for tests)
- `SessionState` in `lib/domain/session/` — pure-Dart cross-cutting state
  (transport intent, projection, scene name)
- Workstation chrome: top toolbar (wordmark, inline-editable scene name,
  play/stop transport, time-domain placeholder, projection toggle), left
  rail (6 buttons, only Mix enabled), bottom status (LIVE dot, CPU + drops),
  right inspector (tap to expand 28→320px, hosts a master-volume fader)
- Mix surface stub: one play/stop button bound to `System.audioTest`, one
  peak meter currently fed by `cpuLoad` as a stand-in
- Unit + widget + integration tests; CI on GitHub Actions; SonarCloud
  workflow (waiting on SONAR_TOKEN)

|----------|----------|---------------------------------|
| Scene    | not impl | `lib/surfaces/scene/`           |

## Where things live

- **Design source-of-truth:** `design system/colors_and_type.css` — the
  Dart tokens under `lib/design/tokens/` are derived. Hand-maintained for now.
- **Design previews:** `design system/preview/*.html` and
  `design system/ui_kits/phi-workstation/*.jsx` — open these when sketching
  new surfaces in Flutter.
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` (analyze + test + coverage),
  `.github/workflows/sonar.yaml` (SonarCloud).
- **SonarCloud:** project key `yvanvds_phi`, organization `yvanvds`.
- **Issue templates:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. Labels: see
  [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## How to start work on something

1. Read this file.
2. Read or update the relevant GitHub issue.
3. Branch from `main` as `<issue-number>-<short-slug>`.
4. Tests first where sensible (pure logic, FFI bridge code, end-to-end).
5. Open a PR; merge once CI + SonarCloud are green.
6. If this PR changed the architecture, layout, or stack, update this file.
